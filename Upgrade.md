### **Step 1: Backup Critical Data**

Before proceeding, ensure that any important data, configurations, or custom drivers are backed up. This includes:

- **System configuration files** (e.g., `/etc/`).
- **Application data** and any user files.
- **Installed software** and packages in case they need to be reinstalled or reconfigured.

### **Step 2: Check Compatibility**

Check whether your Boson board and all required software/drivers are supported on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** or **22.04 LTS**. If the board uses any **custom drivers** or **firmware**, ensure you have access to versions compatible with the upgraded Ubuntu version.

1. Verify if the Boson board’s hardware supports Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04.
2. Check the **NVIDIA drivers** version required for the board and ensure they are compatible with the new Ubuntu version.

### **Step 3: Prepare for OS Upgrade**

1. **Update the Existing System:**
    
    - First, update all the currently installed packages and remove any unused ones:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt dist-upgrade sudo apt autoremove`
        
2. **Disable/Remove Custom Repositories (Optional):**
    
    - If you have any custom PPA repositories that are specific to 18.04, they might break the upgrade. Disable them by commenting them out in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.
3. **Install `update-manager-core`** if it's not installed:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo apt install update-manager-core`
    

### **Step 4: Upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS**

1. **Run the Distribution Upgrade:** To upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04, run the following:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo do-release-upgrade`
    
    - If you want to upgrade directly to **Ubuntu 22.04**, you will need to wait until the system offers the upgrade path. You might first need to upgrade to 20.04 and then move to 22.04, depending on the current software and drivers.
2. Follow the prompts and allow the upgrade to complete. The process will download necessary packages and replace older ones as needed.
    

### **Step 5: Install and Upgrade NVIDIA Drivers**

Once the OS upgrade is complete, you will need to update the **NVIDIA drivers** to versions compatible with the new Ubuntu release.

1. **Add NVIDIA PPA**: Add the official NVIDIA driver repository to get the latest supported drivers for the board:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa sudo apt update`
    
2. **Install NVIDIA Drivers**:
    
    - For Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04, you can install the latest supported driver for your hardware. Typically, for Jetson boards (and likely Boson if it's using an NVIDIA GPU), you might need **NVIDIA driver 450.x or later**. To install the latest driver:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version-number>`
    
    - Replace `<version-number>` with the appropriate driver version you need (e.g., 515, 470, etc.).
3. **Check Driver Installation**: After installing the drivers, reboot the system and confirm the drivers are loaded:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `nvidia-smi`
    

### **Step 6: Install or Upgrade JetPack (if needed)**

If the Boson board requires JetPack for its drivers or software stack, you will need to install the version compatible with your board and the new Ubuntu version.

1. **Download the JetPack SDK**:
    
    - For Jetson boards, JetPack is downloaded via the **NVIDIA SDK Manager**. If you’re using JetPack on Boson, follow these steps:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/jetson/sdkmanager/sdkmanager_<version>-amd64.deb sudo apt install ./sdkmanager_<version>-amd64.deb`
    
2. **Run the NVIDIA SDK Manager**: The SDK Manager will help you install JetPack and all necessary components (CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, etc.):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sdkmanager`
    
    - Select the appropriate version of JetPack (for Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04, JetPack 5.x is typically used).
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to install or upgrade JetPack.

### **Step 7: Update Other Drivers and Packages**

If your Boson board uses other drivers or custom hardware, update them to their Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 compatible versions.

1. **Firmware and Peripheral Drivers**:
    
    - Some peripherals or custom hardware on the Boson board may require specific drivers. Ensure these drivers are updated to match the new Ubuntu kernel.
    - You can check the hardware using `lshw` or `lspci` and ensure that all necessary drivers are installed.
2. **Reinstall or Update Custom Packages**:
    
    - Reinstall any previously removed or custom packages that you need on the new OS.
    - Verify that software such as Docker, Python libraries, or other utilities is working as expected after the upgrade.

### **Step 8: Test the Board’s Functionality**

1. After upgrading everything, test the system thoroughly:
    
    - **GPU Acceleration**: Ensure GPU acceleration is working by running a CUDA sample or AI workload if relevant.
    - **Peripheral Devices**: Check if all attached devices or custom peripherals are working correctly.
    - **General System Stability**: Ensure the system is stable and there are no driver conflicts.
2. **Resolve any issues**:
    
    - If you encounter issues with missing drivers or broken packages, consult the relevant logs (`dmesg`, `syslog`, etc.) and reconfigure any broken dependencies:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo dpkg --configure -a sudo apt --fix-broken install`
        

### **Summary of Steps**:

1. Backup your data.
2. Update and prepare the existing system.
3. Perform a distribution upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04.
4. Install or upgrade NVIDIA drivers.
5. Install or update JetPack (if needed).
6. Update other drivers or custom hardware drivers.
7. Test the board functionality after the upgrade.
