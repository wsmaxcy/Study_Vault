[[Nessus]] is a vulnerability scanner. Basically, if you are doing an external assessment you use this tool. Let these scans run and while they do you go out and find information. This is also true with internal scans. 

Activation Code for mine :`EYNB-LZ6T-LJWT-FN26`
Valid until: `2024-07-28`

Basically, make a scan, then activate the scan.

When scan is done, there will be a check mark that shows you it's finished.
