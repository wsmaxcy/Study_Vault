Introduce the Five stage of ethical hacking

## Moving into the Malicious things
Don't be a dick

## Five Stages
1. Reconnaissance - Information Gathering 
	1. Active - going to the site and scanning, enumerating, etc
	2. Passive - Going to google and searching for someone. Looking for LinkedIn pics, badges, etc. nothing happening against the company
2. Scanning and Enumeration
	1. Using tools like [[Nessus]] and [[Nmap]] and [[Nikto]] to actively see what is going on in the clients environment 
	2. Open ports, vulnerabilities
	3. Enumeration - Looking at items on network, finding info, googling further
3. Exploitation (Gaining Access)
	1. Use the exploit to gain access to the environment/network
4. Maintaining Access 
	1. How do we maintain the access so that we can always get back in
5. Covering Tracks
	1. Delete all accounts, remove tools, etc.

Will be going over heavily for steps 1-3
It is all similar in these stages of hacking, but the overall methodology is going to be the same.

Going to go in the course in this order.
