## Overview
SIPcrack is a suite of tools designed to test the security of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and VoIP (Voice over IP) networks by capturing and cracking SIP authentication credentials. SIPcrack consists of two main tools: `sipdump` and `sipcrack`. `sipdump` is used to capture SIP authentication handshakes from network traffic, while `sipcrack` is used to crack the captured hashes offline by performing a dictionary attack or brute-force attack.

SIPcrack is widely used by penetration testers, VoIP security researchers, and network administrators to assess the security of VoIP deployments and ensure that SIP credentials are adequately protected.

## Features
- **SIP Authentication Capture:** Captures SIP authentication handshakes from network traffic using `sipdump`.
- **Offline Password Cracking:** Performs offline dictionary or brute-force attacks on captured SIP hashes using `sipcrack`.
- **Supports Multiple Authentication Methods:** Works with common SIP authentication methods, such as MD5 digest authentication.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Available on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and can be compiled for Windows with appropriate dependencies.
- **Dictionary Attack and Brute-Force Attack:** Supports both dictionary-based and brute-force methods for cracking SIP credentials.

## Installation

### On Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS):

1. **Install SIPcrack via GitHub:**

   - Clone the SIPcrack repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SIPcrack/sipcrack.git
cd sipcrack
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
```

   - **On macOS using Homebrew:**

```sh
brew install libpcap
```

3. **Compile SIPcrack:**

   - Compile the tool using `make`:

```sh
make
```

4. **Run SIPcrack:**

   - You can now run `sipdump` and `sipcrack` from the compiled directory:

```sh
sudo ./sipdump
sudo ./sipcrack
```

### On Windows:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Install a compatible C compiler and dependencies (such as `libpcap` for Windows).

2. **Compile SIPcrack:**

   - Use a suitable build system like `CMake` or a compatible compiler (e.g., `MinGW` or `Visual Studio`) to build the binaries.

3. **Run SIPcrack:**

   - Run `sipdump` and `sipcrack` from the command prompt with the necessary privileges.

## Basic Usage
SIPcrack includes two main tools, `sipdump` for capturing SIP authentication handshakes and `sipcrack` for cracking those captured hashes. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Capturing SIP Authentication Handshakes
To capture SIP authentication handshakes on a network interface:

1. **Run sipdump to Capture Handshakes:**

```sh
sudo ./sipdump -i <network-interface>
```

   - **`-i <network-interface>`**: Specifies the network interface to listen on (e.g., `eth0`).

2. **Save Captured Handshakes:**

   - The captured SIP authentication handshakes will be saved to a file named `dumpfile` in the current directory.

### Cracking SIP Passwords
To crack SIP passwords from captured handshakes:

1. **Run sipcrack with a Wordlist:**

```sh
./sipcrack -w wordlist.txt dumpfile
```

   - **`-w wordlist.txt`**: Specifies the path to the wordlist file for dictionary attacks.
   - **`dumpfile`**: Specifies the file containing captured SIP handshakes.

2. **Brute-Force Attack:**

   - If a wordlist is not available, `sipcrack` can also perform a brute-force attack:

```sh
./sipcrack -b dumpfile
```

   - **`-b`**: Initiates a brute-force attack mode.

### Customizing the Capture Process
To customize the capture process, such as specifying a different port:

1. **Run sipdump with a Custom Port:**

```sh
sudo ./sipdump -i <network-interface> -p 5060
```

   - **`-p 5060`**: Specifies the SIP port to listen on (5060 is the default SIP port).

## Key Features and Commands

### SIP Authentication Capture
- **Description:** Captures SIP authentication handshakes from network traffic, allowing for offline password cracking.
- **Usage:**
```sh
sudo ./sipdump -i <network-interface>
```

### Offline Password Cracking
- **Description:** Cracks captured SIP hashes using a dictionary attack or brute-force attack.
- **Usage:**
```sh
./sipcrack -w wordlist.txt dumpfile
```

### Dictionary Attack
- **Description:** Uses a provided wordlist to attempt to crack SIP credentials by testing each word against the captured hashes.
- **Usage:**
```sh
./sipcrack -w wordlist.txt dumpfile
```

### Brute-Force Attack
- **Description:** Attempts to crack SIP credentials by exhaustively trying all possible combinations.
- **Usage:**
```sh
./sipcrack -b dumpfile
```

### Customizing Network Capture
- **Description:** Allows users to specify network interfaces and ports to customize the SIP handshake capture process.
- **Usage:**
```sh
sudo ./sipdump -i <network-interface> -p 5060
```

## Tools for VoIP Security and Offensive Security Using SIPcrack

- **SIP Credential Cracking:** Use SIPcrack to crack SIP authentication credentials and assess the security of VoIP networks.
- **VoIP Security Testing:** Evaluate the security posture of VoIP deployments by capturing and analyzing SIP authentication handshakes.
- **Network Monitoring and Analysis:** Monitor network traffic for SIP authentication attempts and identify potential security weaknesses.
- **Post-Exploitation:** Utilize cracked SIP credentials to gain unauthorized access to VoIP systems and further exploit the network.
- **Password Auditing:** Test the strength of SIP passwords and ensure that weak or default credentials are not being used.

## Best Practices
- **Use SIPcrack Responsibly:** Always ensure that you have proper authorization before using SIPcrack for offensive security tasks and network assessments.
- **Stay Within Legal Boundaries:** Be aware of the legal implications of using SIPcrack and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
- **Combine with Other Tools:** Use SIPcrack alongside other VoIP security tools like [[SIPVicious]], [[Wireshark]], and [[Nmap]] for comprehensive assessments.
- **Regularly Update SIPcrack:** Keep SIPcrack up-to-date to benefit from the latest features, security enhancements, and bug fixes.
- **Analyze Results Carefully:** Review the output of SIPcrack commands carefully to identify potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and opportunities for further exploitation.
