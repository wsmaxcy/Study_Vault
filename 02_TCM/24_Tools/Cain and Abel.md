## Basic Usage
Cain and Abel is primarily a Windows GUI application. Here are some common tasks and usage examples:

### Sniffing Network Traffic
1. **Start Cain and Abel:**
   - Open Cain and Abel from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

2. **Select the Network Interface:**
   - Click on the "Sniffer" tab and select the appropriate network interface from the list.

3. **Enable the Sniffer:**
   - Click the "Start/Stop Sniffer" button (the yellow button) to begin sniffing network traffic.

4. **Perform ARP Poisoning:**
   - Click the "APR" tab and add a new ARP poisoning filter. Select the hosts you want to ARP poison and click "OK".

5. **Capture and Analyze Data:**
   - The sniffer will capture network traffic, and you can analyze captured packets to extract sensitive information.

### Cracking Password Hashes
1. **Import Hashes:**
   - Click on the "Cracker" tab and choose the type of hash you want to crack (e.g., NTLM hashes).

2. **Add Hashes to Crack:**
   - Right-click in the hash list area and select "Add to list". Import the hash or manually enter the hash value.

3. **Select Attack Type:**
   - Right-click on the hash entry and choose the attack type (e.g., Dictionary Attack, Brute-Force Attack).

4. **Start Cracking:**
   - Configure the attack settings and click "Start" to begin the password-cracking process.

### Recovering Wireless Network Keys
1. **Start Wireless Key Recovery:**
   - Click on the "Wireless" tab and select the wireless network adapter.

2. **Capture Wireless Packets:**
   - Start the sniffer to capture wireless packets and extract the wireless network keys.

### Cracking Windows Passwords
1. **Access the "LSA Secrets" Tab:**
   - Click on the "LSA Secrets" tab to view and crack cached Windows passwords stored in the Local Security Authority (LSA).

2. **Decrypt LSA Secrets:**
   - Use the built-in decrypting tools to reveal the cached passwords and secrets.
