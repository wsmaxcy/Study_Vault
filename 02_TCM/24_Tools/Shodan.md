# Shodan

## Overview
**Shodan** is a search engine for Internet-connected devices, known as the "Google for hackers." Unlike traditional search engines that index web content, Shodan indexes information about devices connected to the Internet, such as servers, routers, webcams, IoT devices, and more. It gathers data on devices' operating systems, software versions, open ports, and even security vulnerabilities by continuously scanning the Internet for publicly accessible devices and services. 

Shodan is widely used by penetration testers, security researchers, and network administrators to perform reconnaissance, assess exposure to the Internet, identify vulnerable devices, and gather threat intelligence. It provides powerful search capabilities, filters, and an API that can be integrated into custom tools and workflows for automated scanning and monitoring.

## Features
- **Device Search Engine:** Searches for Internet-connected devices, revealing detailed information about their configurations and vulnerabilities.
- **Geolocation Data:** Provides geographic information about the devices, including country, city, and coordinates.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies devices with known vulnerabilities by cross-referencing with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.
- **Filters and Search Operators:** Offers advanced search filters and operators to refine queries and target specific device types or configurations.
- **API Integration:** Provides a powerful API for integrating Shodan data into custom tools, applications, and workflows.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Allows users to set up monitoring and alerts to notify them of changes in the status of devices or networks.

## Installation

### Shodan CLI Installation:

1. **Install Python and Pip:**

   - Ensure Python and pip (Python's package installer) are installed on your system.

2. **Install the Shodan Command-Line Interface (CLI):**

   - Install the Shodan CLI using pip:

```sh
pip install shodan
```

3. **Initialize Shodan CLI with Your API Key:**

   - Sign up for a Shodan account at [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) and retrieve your API key from your account settings.
   - Initialize Shodan with your API key:

```sh
shodan init <YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY>
```

## Basic Usage
Shodan provides a variety of search capabilities and commands to help users find and analyze Internet-connected devices. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Searching for Devices
To search for devices with specific characteristics:

```sh
shodan search "apache"
```

- **`"apache"`**: Searches for devices running Apache HTTP server.

### Filtering Search Results
To refine search results using filters:

```sh
shodan search "nginx country:US"
```

- **`"nginx country:US"`**: Searches for devices running Nginx located in the United States.

### Checking Device Information
To get detailed information about a specific IP address:

```sh
shodan host <IP_ADDRESS>
```

- **`<IP_ADDRESS>`**: Specifies the IP address of the device to analyze.

### Identifying Vulnerable Devices
To search for devices with specific vulnerabilities:

```sh
shodan search "vuln:CVE-2017-0144"
```

- **`"vuln:CVE-2017-0144"`**: Searches for devices vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit (CVE-2017-0144).

### Downloading Search Results
To download search results to a file:

```sh
shodan download results.json.gz "apache country:DE"
```

- **`results.json.gz`**: Specifies the filename to save the results.
- **`"apache country:DE"`**: Specifies the search query for Apache servers in Germany.

### Using Shodan API
To interact with Shodan using its API for automated tasks:

1. **Install Shodan Python Library:**

   - The Shodan CLI installation also includes the Python library. Import it in your Python scripts:

```python
import shodan
```

2. **Initialize the Shodan Client with API Key:**

```python
api = shodan.Shodan('<YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY>')
```

3. **Perform Searches Using the API:**

```python
results = api.search('apache')
for result in results['matches']:
    print(result['ip_str'], result['data'])
```

### Setting Up Alerts
To set up an alert for a specific IP range or CIDR:

```sh
shodan alert create "My Alert" 192.168.1.0/24
```

- **`"My Alert"`**: Specifies the name of the alert.
- **`192.168.1.0/24`**: Specifies the IP range or CIDR to monitor.
