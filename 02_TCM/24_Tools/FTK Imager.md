## Overview
**FTK Imager** (Forensic Toolkit Imager) is a free, robust digital forensics tool used for creating forensic images of hard drives, memory, and other storage media. Developed by AccessData, FTK Imager allows investigators to acquire data without altering the original evidence, ensuring data integrity during investigations. It is widely used by digital forensics professionals, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity teams to perform quick and reliable imaging, verify the integrity of forensic images, and analyze digital evidence for incidents such as data breaches, cybercrimes, and internal investigations.

FTK Imager supports various file systems and can create forensic images in multiple formats, including E01 (EnCase Evidence File), DD (raw), AFF (Advanced Forensic Format), and AD1 (AccessData Custom Content Image). Additionally, it provides basic analysis capabilities, such as viewing files and folders, recovering deleted files, and exporting data from evidence files.

## Basic Usage
FTK Imager provides a user-friendly GUI for performing a wide range of forensic imaging and analysis tasks. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Creating a Forensic Image
To create a forensic image of a drive or partition:

1. **Open FTK Imager and Select Evidence Source:**

   - Launch FTK Imager and go to **"File"** > **"Create Disk Image…"**.

2. **Select Source Type:**

   - Choose the source type (e.g., Physical Drive, Logical Drive, Image File) and click **"Next"**.

3. **Select the Source Drive or Image:**

   - Select the drive or image to be imaged and click **"Finish"**.

4. **Configure Image Destination:**

   - Click **"Add"** to configure the destination for the forensic image, selecting the image type (e.g., E01, DD, AFF) and providing a destination path.

5. **Verify Image Integrity:**

   - Optionally, enable **"Verify images after they are created"** to calculate hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) for verifying data integrity.

6. **Create the Image:**

   - Click **"Start"** to begin the imaging process.

### Viewing Files and Folders
To view files and folders in a forensic image:

1. **Open the Image File:**

   - Go to **"File"** > **"Add Evidence Item…"** and select **"Image File"**.

2. **Select the Image File:**

   - Browse and select the forensic image file to open.

3. **Navigate the File System:**

   - Use the left pane to navigate the file system, viewing files, directories, and other artifacts within the forensic image.

### Recovering Deleted Files
To recover deleted files from a forensic image:

1. **Identify Deleted Files:**

   - Browse the file system within the forensic image and locate files marked as deleted (indicated by a red X).

2. **Recover Deleted Files:**

   - Right-click on the deleted file and select **"Export Files…"** to save the recovered file to a specified location.

### Capturing Live Memory
To capture live memory from a running system:

1. **Start FTK Imager on the Target System:**

   - Launch FTK Imager on the running system.

2. **Go to Memory Capture:**

   - Click on **"File"** > **"Capture Memory…"**.
