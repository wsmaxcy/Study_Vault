## Overview
**Recon-ng** is a full-featured web reconnaissance framework written in Python, designed for open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering and reconnaissance. It provides a modular architecture that allows users to easily add, remove, and configure modules to perform various tasks, such as domain and IP address reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, and social engineering research. Recon-ng is widely used by penetration testers, security researchers, and ethical hackers to automate the process of collecting and analyzing publicly available information about targets.

Recon-ng comes with a variety of built-in modules and can be extended with custom scripts, making it a versatile tool for conducting thorough reconnaissance during the initial stages of a penetration test or security assessment.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture:** Supports a wide range of modules for domain reconnaissance, IP address analysis, social media harvesting, and more.
- **API Integration:** Integrates with various APIs to gather information from sources like WHOIS, Shodan, Have I Been Pwned, and more.
- **Database Support:** Stores collected data in a SQLite database for easy access, reporting, and analysis.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Offers a robust command-line interface that mimics the look and feel of a Metasploit-like framework.
- **Extensible with Custom Modules:** Allows users to develop and add custom modules for specialized tasks.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Available for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows environments.

## Basic Usage
Recon-ng provides a variety of modules and commands for gathering information and performing reconnaissance. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Starting Recon-ng
To start Recon-ng and initialize a new workspace:

```sh
recon-ng
```

- This command launches the Recon-ng framework.

### Creating and Using a Workspace
To create a new workspace and switch to it:

```sh
workspaces create example_workspace
workspaces select example_workspace
```

- **`workspaces create example_workspace`**: Creates a new workspace named `example_workspace`.
- **`workspaces select example_workspace`**: Switches to the newly created workspace.

### Adding a Target Domain
To add a target domain to your current workspace:

```sh
add domains example.com
```

- **`add domains example.com`**: Adds `example.com` as a target domain to the workspace.

### Running a Module
To run a module, such as `recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web`, to find hosts related to a domain:

```sh
modules load recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web
run
```

- **`modules load recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web`**: Loads the module for finding hosts via Google Site.
- **`run`**: Executes the loaded module.

### Using API Keys
To use API keys for enhanced data gathering, add them to Recon-ng:

```sh
keys add shodan_api <YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY>
```

- **`keys add shodan_api <YOUR_SHODAN_API_KEY>`**: Adds the Shodan API key for use with Shodan-related modules.

### Viewing and Exporting Collected Data
To view collected data and export it for reporting:

```sh
show hosts
export json /path/to/export.json
```

- **`show hosts`**: Displays all hosts collected in the workspace.
- **`export json /path/to/export.json`**: Exports the collected data to a JSON file.

### Installing Additional Modules
To install additional modules directly from the Recon-ng interface:

```sh
marketplace install recon/hosts-hosts/shodan_ip
```

- **`marketplace install recon/hosts-hosts/shodan_ip`**: Installs the Shodan IP module from the marketplace.
