## Basic Usage
Volatility provides a command-line interface with various plugins for analyzing memory dumps. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Listing Available Plugins
To list all available plugins in Volatility:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp --info
```

- **`-f memory.dmp`**: Specifies the memory dump file to analyze.
- **`--info`**: Lists all available plugins and their descriptions.

### Analyzing Running Processes
To list all running processes in a memory dump:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp windows.pslist.PsList
```

- **`windows.pslist.PsList`**: Uses the `pslist` plugin to list all running processes.

### Extracting Network Connections
To extract active network connections from a memory dump:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp windows.netscan.NetScan
```

- **`windows.netscan.NetScan`**: Uses the `netscan` plugin to list all network connections.

### Dumping a Process's Memory
To dump the memory of a specific process:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp --pid <PROCESS_ID> windows.memmap.MemMap
```

- **`--pid <PROCESS_ID>`**: Specifies the process ID to dump memory for.
- **`windows.memmap.MemMap`**: Uses the `memmap` plugin to map the process's memory.

### Analyzing Loaded DLLs
To list all DLLs loaded by a specific process:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp --pid <PROCESS_ID> windows.dlllist.DllList
```

- **`windows.dlllist.DllList`**: Uses the `dlllist` plugin to list DLLs loaded by the specified process.

### Detecting Malware
To scan for potential malware using Volatility:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp windows.malfind.Malfind
```

- **`windows.malfind.Malfind`**: Uses the `malfind` plugin to detect potential malicious code injections in memory.

### Extracting Registry Keys
To extract specific registry keys from a memory dump:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp windows.registry.printkey.PrintKey --key "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
```

- **`windows.registry.printkey.PrintKey`**: Uses the `printkey` plugin to extract registry keys.

### Generating a Process Tree
To generate a tree view of parent-child process relationships:

```sh
python3 vol.py -f memory.dmp windows.pstree.PsTree
```

- **`windows.pstree.PsTree`**: Uses the `pstree` plugin to generate a process tree.
