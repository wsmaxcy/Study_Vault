3. **View Exploit Details:**
   - Click on an exploit to view detailed information, including the exploit code and usage instructions.

### Command-Line Interface
Exploit-DB can also be accessed using the [[searchsploit]] command in Kali Linux.

#### Search for Exploits
```sh
searchsploit keyword
```

#### View Exploit Details
```sh
searchsploit -x exploit/path
```

#### Update Exploit Database
```sh
searchsploit -u
```

### Practical Examples

#### Searching for an Exploit
To search for all exploits related to Apache:
```sh
searchsploit apache
```

#### Viewing an Exploit
To view the details of a specific exploit:
```sh
searchsploit -x exploits/webapps/12345.txt
```

## Best Practices
- **Verify Exploits:** Always verify the exploit code and its impact in a controlled environment before using it on live systems.
- **Stay Updated:** Regularly update the exploit database to access the latest exploits.
- **Use Ethically:** Ensure that exploits are used ethically and legally, with appropriate permissions.
