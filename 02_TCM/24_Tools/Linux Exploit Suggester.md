## Overview
Linux Exploit Suggester is a tool designed to assist penetration testers and security researchers in identifying potential kernel exploits that can be used to escalate privileges on a Linux system. It compares the current system's kernel version and configuration against a database of known exploits to suggest applicable ones. This tool is especially useful during the post-exploitation phase of a penetration test when attempting to elevate privileges on a compromised host.

## Features
- **Kernel Exploit Identification:** Matches the kernel version of the target system with known vulnerabilities.
- **User-Friendly Output:** Provides clear and concise information about potential exploits, including links to the exploit code and details.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Supports a wide range of Linux distributions and kernel versions.
- **Command Line Interface:** Lightweight and easy to use directly from the terminal.

## Installation

### Download Linux Exploit Suggester:
1. **Clone the Repository:**


``` sh
git clone https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester.git
cd linux-exploit-suggester
```


2. **Download Directly:**
   - Use `wget` or `curl` to download the script directly:


```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```
   
   or
   
```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```

3. **Make the Script Executable:**

```sh
chmod +x linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```

## Basic Usage
Linux Exploit Suggester is run from the command line. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Run Linux Exploit Suggester
To run the script with default settings:
```sh
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```

### Specify Kernel Version
To specify a kernel version manually (useful if you cannot run the script directly on the target system):
```sh
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh --kernel 4.15.0-72-generic
```

### Save Output to a File
To save the output of Linux Exploit Suggester to a file for later analysis:
```sh
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh > exploit_suggestions.txt
```

## Understanding the Output
The output of Linux Exploit Suggester typically includes:

- **Exploit Name:** The name of the potential exploit.
- **Exploit Description:** A brief description of what the exploit does.
- **Kernel Versions Affected:** The range of kernel versions known to be vulnerable to the exploit.
- **Exploit Link:** A link to the exploit code or detailed write-up.
- **Rank:** Indicates the exploit's likelihood of success, usually rated as "recommended," "possible," or "not recommended."

### Example Output:

```plaintext
[+] [CVE-2017-6074] DCCP double-free (local root)
   Details: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41356
   Exposure: probable
   Tags: [ ubuntu=(16.04|16.10) ]
   Download URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/download/41356
```

## Key Exploits Identified

### 1. Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195)
   - **Description:** A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel’s memory subsystem that allows an unprivileged user to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - **Command:** After downloading the exploit:
 - 
```sh
gcc -o dirtycow dirtycow.c -lpthread -lcrypt
./dirtycow
```
   - **Mitigation:** Upgrade to a patched kernel version and restrict access to vulnerable systems.

### 2. OverlayFS Privilege Escalation (CVE-2015-1328)
   - **Description:** A vulnerability in the OverlayFS file system that allows local users to gain root privileges.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - **Command:** After compiling the exploit:
 - Type:
```sh
./overlayfs_exploit
```
   - **Mitigation:** Apply kernel patches and use up-to-date kernels.

### 3. Perf_swevent Privilege Escalation (CVE-2013-2094)
   - **Description:** A vulnerability in the Linux kernel’s performance counters subsystem that allows local users to gain root privileges.
   - **Exploitation:**
     - **Command:** After compiling the exploit:
 - Then type
```sh
./perf_swevent_exploit
```
   - **Mitigation:** Apply kernel patches and disable unneeded kernel features.

## Tools for Post-Exploitation Using Linux Exploit Suggester

- **Privilege Escalation:** Use Linux Exploit Suggester to identify potential exploits for elevating privileges on a compromised Linux system.
- **System Hardening Audits:** System administrators can use Linux Exploit Suggester to audit systems and identify vulnerabilities in the kernel that need to be patched.
- **Vulnerability Research:** Identify kernel vulnerabilities that could be exploited in older or less secure environments.

## Best Practices
- **Run with Limited Privileges:** Start by running Linux Exploit Suggester as a non-root user to identify potential privilege escalation paths.
- **Analyze Output Carefully:** Review the suggested exploits and determine the most effective escalation method based on the target environment.
- **Use in Combination with Other Tools:** Use Linux Exploit Suggester alongside other enumeration tools like [[LinEnum]], [[linpeas.sh]], and [[pspy]] for comprehensive assessments.
- **Keep Linux Exploit Suggester Updated:** Regularly update Linux Exploit Suggester to benefit from new checks and features.
