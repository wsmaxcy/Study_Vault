## Overview
WebScarab is an open-source web security application testing tool designed to help security professionals and penetration testers analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic between the browser and the web server. It acts as a proxy, allowing users to intercept and manipulate web traffic in real-time. WebScarab is widely used for security testing of web applications to identify vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, session management issues, and other web security flaws.

WebScarab provides several modules for performing various tasks, including content analysis, session ID analysis, and fuzzing, making it a versatile tool for comprehensive web security assessments.

## Features
- **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy:** Intercepts and modifies HTTP/HTTPS traffic between the client and server.
- **Manual Request Editor:** Allows users to manually modify HTTP requests and observe responses.
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Provides modules for automated scanning for common web vulnerabilities.
- **Session ID Analysis:** Analyzes session cookies and IDs to identify weak or insecure session management practices.
- **Fuzzing Capabilities:** Supports fuzzing of HTTP requests to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Content Analysis and Rewriting:** Analyzes and rewrites content in HTTP responses to identify and test for security issues.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Available on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows.

   - Navigate to the directory where WebScarab was downloaded and run:

```sh
java -jar webscarab-selfcontained-<version>.jar
```

### On Windows:

1. **Download and Install Java:**

   - Download and install Java from the [official Java website](https://www.java.com/).

2. **Download WebScarab:**

   - Download the latest version of WebScarab from the [OWASP WebScarab Project Page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project).

3. **Run WebScarab:**

   - Double-click the `webscarab-selfcontained-<version>.jar` file to start WebScarab.

## Basic Usage
WebScarab can be used in several modes depending on the task. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Intercepting HTTP/HTTPS Traffic
To use WebScarab as a proxy to intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS traffic:

1. **Configure Your Browser to Use WebScarab as a Proxy:**

   - Set your browser to use `localhost` and port `8008` as the proxy.

2. **Start Intercepting Traffic:**

   - Run WebScarab and click on **"Proxy"** to enable the proxy mode.

### Manual Request Editing
To manually edit HTTP requests and analyze responses:

1. **Capture a Request:**

   - Click on **"Proxy"** and **"Intercept"** to enable request interception.

2. **Modify the Request:**

   - Edit the captured HTTP request in the request editor.

3. **Send the Modified Request:**

   - Click **"Accept changes"** to send the modified request to the server.

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning
To perform automated vulnerability scanning using WebScarab:

1. **Configure Scanning Modules:**

   - Go to **"Tools"** and select **"Spider"** or **"Fuzzer"** to configure automated scanning options.

2. **Run the Scanner:**

   - Start the scan by clicking on **"Start"** and analyze the results for potential vulnerabilities.

### Fuzzing HTTP Requests
To fuzz HTTP requests to find vulnerabilities:

1. **Select the Fuzzing Module:**

   - Go to **"Tools"** and select **"Fuzzer"**.

2. **Configure Fuzzing Parameters:**

   - Choose the HTTP request to fuzz and configure the fuzzing parameters, such as wordlists or payloads.

3. **Start the Fuzzing Process:**

   - Click **"Start"** to begin fuzzing and monitor the responses for any anomalies or vulnerabilities.

### Session ID Analysis
To analyze session cookies and IDs for security weaknesses:

1. **Capture HTTP Requests with Session Cookies:**

   - Use WebScarab to intercept HTTP requests that include session cookies.

2. **Analyze Session IDs:**

   - Go to **"Tools"** and select **"Session ID Analysis"** to analyze the captured session IDs for predictability and security.
