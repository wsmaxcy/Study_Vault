## Overview
**theHarvester** is an open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering tool used to collect data about domain names, email addresses, IP addresses, subdomains, and other publicly accessible information. It is widely used by penetration testers, security researchers, and ethical hackers to perform reconnaissance and gather information about targets during the initial stages of an engagement. theHarvester works by querying various public sources, such as search engines, social media platforms, and public databases, to retrieve valuable data that can be used to assess the security posture of a target organization.

By automating the process of gathering open-source information, theHarvester helps users build a comprehensive profile of their target, including potentially sensitive information that could be exploited in further attacks.

## Features
- **Domain and Email Enumeration:** Collects email addresses, domain names, subdomains, IP addresses, and more.
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Queries various public sources, including search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo), social media (LinkedIn, Twitter), DNS servers, and more.
- **Automated OSINT Collection:** Automates the process of collecting open-source intelligence, saving time and effort.
- **Customizable Queries:** Allows users to specify data sources and customize queries to target specific information.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Available on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows environments.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Provides a powerful command-line interface for scripting and automation.

## Basic Usage
theHarvester provides a variety of options for gathering information about a target. Here are some common commands and usage examples:

### Domain Enumeration
To enumerate email addresses and subdomains associated with a domain:

```sh
theHarvester -d example.com -b all
```

- **`-d example.com`**: Specifies the target domain.
- **`-b all`**: Uses all available data sources to gather information.

### Email Address Enumeration
To specifically enumerate email addresses associated with a domain:

```sh
theHarvester -d example.com -b google -l 500
```

- **`-b google`**: Specifies Google as the search engine to use.
- **`-l 500`**: Limits the search to the first 500 results.

### IP Address and Subdomain Enumeration
To enumerate IP addresses and subdomains associated with a domain:

```sh
theHarvester -d example.com -b bing -l 200 -f output.html
```

- **`-b bing`**: Specifies Bing as the search engine to use.
- **`-f output.html`**: Exports the results to an HTML file for easy viewing.

### Using Specific Data Sources
To use specific data sources for more targeted searches:

```sh
theHarvester -d example.com -b linkedin,crtsh
```

- **`-b linkedin,crtsh`**: Uses LinkedIn and crt.sh as data sources to gather information.

### Saving Results to a File
To save the results to a text file for later analysis:

```sh
theHarvester -d example.com -b google -l 200 -f results.txt
```

- **`-f results.txt`**: Exports the results to a text file named "results.txt".

### Verbose Output
To enable verbose output for more detailed information during the search:

```sh
theHarvester -d example.com -b all -v
```

- **`-v`**: Enables verbose mode.
