Looking at what a website is built with. Looks specifically with web apps.

1. [[BuiltWith]] - shows the following tech that the website is run with
	1. shows widgets, frameworks, and other information.
	2. Frameworks - Shows what their back end looks like.
		1. For huge websites, it is a bit overwhelming, so maybe we should use...
2. [[Wappalyzer]] - Extension because it shows you an indication right away
	1. More of an active reconnaissance because it is actively scanning, but more of the normal style of running.
3. [[WhatWeb]] - Does give us info without as pretty of a layout.
	1. Shows info on what versions of software is running, can be more granular than Wappalyzer
