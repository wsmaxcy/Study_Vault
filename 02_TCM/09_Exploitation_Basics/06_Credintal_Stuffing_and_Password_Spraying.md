## Credential Stuffing
---- 
What is it? - Injecting breached account creds hoping that it will work
this is done by getting LinkedIn Leaks, or Equifax Leaks, etc.

take these creds, pass them through to the site login.

take these leaks and throw them at a website.

There is a tool called [[FoxyProxy]] that you an use to add on to Firefox. This way is a simple way to add in a proxy to use Burp Suite. But, I just use the regular browser from Burp, so it's fine.

Easy way to do this is using [[Burp Suite]] and using the Pitchfork on the Intruder section. This will use the username for 1 and password for 1 only once. so it will only use one for each, not every single time. 

Make sure to know this to make sure you dont lock out a bunch of users. If you do this, it could basically cause a DDoS, so be careful in a real pentest

## Password Spraying
----
This is when there is one username, then you spray one password for the same username to try to get access.
