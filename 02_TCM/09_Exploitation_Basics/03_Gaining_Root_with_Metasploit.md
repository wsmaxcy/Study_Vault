Basically, automated tool to use [[searchsploit]] and [[Metasploit]] together

## What we use to get the exploit going
1. type ``msfconsole` to get the console to come up
2. Search for the exploit to use, in this example we use `trans2open`
3. set `rhost` - remote hose (aka victim)
4. you can type `options` to see if everything went in
5. using `show targets` can help determine if you are attacking the correct machine

When it doesn't work, we can use payload options. it shows what payload we are using. When we see options again, we can then select the payload that we use. to see all the payloads, double tap `tab` to see them all. We are going to try to use a non staged payload to see if this works. We hit `options` again to make sure that it went through. Now we run `explot` and see that it worked We are user `root` and so we are done. here we are going to focus on por `80` and `443` to try some manual exploitations.
