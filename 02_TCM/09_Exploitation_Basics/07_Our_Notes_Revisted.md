We got NMAP, Default Webpage on Apache
now we did some exploiting.

We need to have a screenshot of what we did and how to get there. We need to show that we can use the shadow file, and any other thing that we can get info from. If there was any undetected malicious activity. If we were caught, that is something we should mention as well as if we weren't caught. Access to a machine is a critical finding.. etc. Make these assessment notes something that works for me. As long as we have screenshots and proof, we are good.

Next we will look at a bunch of attacks and build upon techniques that we can use.
