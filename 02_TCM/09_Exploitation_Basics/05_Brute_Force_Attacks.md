Say we got an [[SSH]] instance that is available. We are going to test with
1. Default usernames/passwords
2. Weak Passwords
3. And test the Blue team

Were going to use the tool [[Hydra]] to brute force the ssh. the syntax we are going to use is this
`hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.1:22 -t 4 -V`

going to start to attempt connecting to ssh to see what happens

do the same thing in [[Metasploit]] to see multiple ways

`run auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`

set the password file, username, threads, etc. then press exploit
